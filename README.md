# Paradise Lost
A modern plain english translation of John Milton's Paradise Lost.

A few notes:
- I am simply interested in the literature. Religious notions neither here nor there.
- This will be subjective, as it is my own interperetation.
- This is a work in progress, in my free time.

## Book I

Satan revolted from God and was cast out to Chaos, a dark abyss. With him he took legions of angels.

A considerable amount of time is spent describing the abyss.

Satan awakens his followers to council their position. He starts by seething about what God has done.

Beelzbub says to Satan: "God really kicked us out. Now what?"

Satan is in rage, believing that he still serves God's purpose.

He exits Hell (Chaos?) through a volcano? He looks to Earth and thinks, "Fine then. *This* will be what I rule." (Perhaps he did not physically go to Earth but instead is thinking of it) He aims to tell his followers of a new world.

Beelzbub says to Satan: "Won't God see this? And revive his armies?"

Satan does not reply, instead storms towards his legion of fallen angels, grabs a spear and shield and launches into a speech. Basically saying "are you with me or have you fallen enough to stay fallen here?"
