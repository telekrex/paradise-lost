# About this Paradise Lost translation
This is my attempt at a modern plain english translation of John Milton's Paradise Lost, for literary purposes. Religious notions are neither here nor there. This work will be subjective, as it is my own interperetation, and just done in my free time. The way I am doing this is I'm reading the book when I have time, taking some notes, and later processing those notes into a simple story. Progress in this repository is equal to my progress reading the actual book. Until I've finished a first read through the entire book, the 'translation' text will be messy and inconsistent. The plan is to first finish reading and interpereting, and then go over with a second draft to make it nicer.

If you'd like to make a suggestion or correction, please do! Use the issue tracker feature for that please. But do this only for the interperetations so far, please do not go further into the book than what is presented here, as I'm trying to keep my interperetation un-influenced, at least until I've read through the complete book once. Thank you.

## Some asides that helped me understand the writing of Paradise Lost
- The work can be thought of as essentially an *expansion* of Genesis, not a replacement, pre/sequel, or other.
- Book 1 is sortof like a cinematic introduction; it is not so much the unfolding of current events. Book 2 is where the story begins.
- The story takes place *during* Adam and Eve. During Books 1-2, I believe Adam and Eve are currently in the Garden of Eden.
- It is written from a *omniscient third person perspective*, where the narration is in a place beyond past, present, or future. John Milton frequently uses real world geography, events, and cultures (at the time of writing between 1658 and 1663) as similie and metaphor, which was really confusing to me when I started reading because a lot of these references feel out of place considering the time in human history that we're supposed to be in for the story. But if I just remember these are an author's way of describing things, I accept. Try to picture it like a dramatized documentary.

## Book I (rough draft)

Satan revolted from God and was cast out to Chaos, a dark abyss. With him he took legions of angels.

A considerable amount of time is spent describing the abyss.

Satan awakens his followers to council their position. He starts by seething about what God has done.

Beelzbub says to Satan: "God really kicked us out. Now what?"

Satan is in rage, believing that he still serves God's purpose.

He exits Hell (Chaos?) through a volcano? He looks to Earth and thinks, "Fine then. *This* will be what I rule." (Perhaps he did not physically go to Earth but instead is thinking of it) He aims to tell his followers of a new world.

Beelzbub says to Satan: "Won't God see this? And revive his armies?"

Satan does not reply, instead storms towards his legion of fallen angels, grabs a spear and shield and launches into a speech. Basically saying "are you with me or have you fallen enough to stay fallen here?"

And so they rise up, Satan's army. They are angel-like in appearance but not in essence. Satan's generals take charge, each of them representing a category of sin.

Generals:
- Beezlbub
- Mammon
- Ashtaroth
- Baalim
- Thammuz
- Peor
- Moloch
- Osiris
- Iris
- Onis
- Belial (Vanity)

They blow into great horns, flutes, and other instruments, which echo into the ceilings of Chaos. The fallen angels join in Satan's rage, then wait for his command.

Satan looks at them. He stands, watching in pride - but also feels sorry that his followers will forever be in pain. He begins to speak, this time between sighs and tears. He speaks of a war to defy God and that Chaos will never hold them - and that it will be settled one way or another.

To this, the army turns to action. They begin to dig up the Chaos hills and take gold from the interior of the Earth, to build a palace with.

The angels sing and dance and enjoy their palace before then sitting down settling down and awaiting council.

## Book 2 (rough draft)

Belial says stuff 'cloaked with garb of reason'; trying to convince the fallen angels that they should wage war on God.

Mammon replies: "What is the point if we don't overthrow God - we will forever be lost in place otherwise. Eternity wasted if we spend it worshipping someone we hate.

But he then argues for peace, suggesting they can create their own greatness from within & just live like their own race, their own lives, ignoring God.

Everyone murmers. Possibly he was warning against creating something just as bad as heaven, thinking of the long term evolution.

Satan then stands, serious, and speaks: reminds them that their domain is not an empire but God's deepest dungeon. He doesn't want to be restricted here.

He suggests that war on God would result in only loss, but peace with God is not possible. Instead, he tells them of heaven's prophecy to create Man and Earth.

Possibly we can disturb God's joy of our ignorance & these creatures 'original state of bliss'.

He says it's that, or hatch vain empires. Calling his own work thus far.. not enough.

Then who does this, and how? (disturbing Man) And how will they travel out of Chaos and survive any Angel encounters?

Satan says "I'll do it, and I'll do it alone."

The fallen agngels all stand and praise him. They leave, dismissed, and go off to their own thoughts.

Satan flies off to the gates of Hell (Chaos). A monster blocks the gate - Death. (Historically, it remains unclear if Death is a woman? man? cerberus? shadow creature? it is not clear).

Satan says, "Let me through."

Death replies, "Aren't you Satan, the one God just banished? Go back to your punishment or I'll hurt you."

And then I have a really hard time understanding the conversation between Satan and Death the next few pages. But basically I think Death is just explaining how serious this gate is.

Satan says, "No, look, I'll set you free from all that. I'm on a journey alone to find Earth and its new race of creatures, to give us a purpose and end God's reign on all creatures."

She (Death) relunctantly opens the gate, unlocked with a key.

Satan enters a perilous black abyss of no direction, cold, hot, chaotic, and filled with loudness and voices. He continues forward until he sees a light, and perhaps a portal to Eden.
