# About this Paradise Lost translation
This is my attempt at a modern plain english translation of John Milton's Paradise Lost, for literary purposes. Religious notions are neither here nor there. This work will be subjective, as it is my own interperetation, and just done in my free time. The way I am doing this is I'm reading the book when I have time, taking some notes, and later processing those notes into a simple story. Progress in this repository is equal to my progress reading the actual book. Until I've finished a first read through the entire book, the 'translation' text will be messy and inconsistent. The plan is to first finish reading and interpereting, and then go over with a second draft to make it nicer.

If you'd like to make a suggestion or correction, please do! Use the issue tracker feature for that please. But do this only for the interperetations so far, please do not go further into the book than what is presented here, as I'm trying to keep my interperetation un-influenced, at least until I've read through the complete book once. Thank you.

## Some asides that helped me understand the writing of Paradise Lost
- The work can be thought of as essentially an *expansion* of Genesis, not a replacement, pre/sequel, or other.
- Book 1 is sortof like a cinematic introduction; it is not so much the unfolding of current events. Book 2 is where the story begins.
- The story takes place *during* Adam and Eve. During Books 1-2, I believe Adam and Eve are currently in the Garden of Eden.
- It is written from a *omniscient third person perspective*, where the narration is in a place beyond past, present, or future. John Milton frequently uses real world geography, events, and cultures (at the time of writing between 1658 and 1663) as similie and metaphor, which was really confusing to me when I started reading because a lot of these references feel out of place considering the time in human history that we're supposed to be in for the story. But if I just remember these are an author's way of describing things, I accept. Try to picture it like a dramatized documentary.

## Book I (rough draft)

Satan revolted from God and was cast out to Chaos, a dark abyss. With him he took legions of angels.

A considerable amount of time is spent describing the abyss.

Satan awakens his followers to council their position. He starts by seething about what God has done.

Beelzbub says to Satan: "God really kicked us out. Now what?"

Satan is in rage, believing that he still serves God's purpose.

He exits Hell (Chaos?) through a volcano? He looks to Earth and thinks, "Fine then. *This* will be what I rule." (Perhaps he did not physically go to Earth but instead is thinking of it) He aims to tell his followers of a new world.

Beelzbub says to Satan: "Won't God see this? And revive his armies?"

Satan does not reply, instead storms towards his legion of fallen angels, grabs a spear and shield and launches into a speech. Basically saying "are you with me or have you fallen enough to stay fallen here?"

And so they rise up, Satan's army. They are angel-like in appearance but not in essence. Satan's generals take charge, each of them representing a category of sin.

Generals:
- Beezlbub
- Mammon
- Ashtaroth
- Baalim
- Thammuz
- Peor
- Moloch
- Osiris
- Iris
- Onis
- Belial (Vanity)

They blow into great horns, flutes, and other instruments, which echo into the ceilings of Chaos. The fallen angels join in Satan's rage, then wait for his command.

Satan looks at them. He stands, watching in pride - but also feels sorry that his followers will forever be in pain. He begins to speak, this time between sighs and tears. He speaks of a war to defy God and that Chaos will never hold them - and that it will be settled one way or another.

To this, the army turns to action. They begin to dig up the Chaos hills and take gold from the interior of the Earth, to build a palace with.

The angels sing and dance and enjoy their palace before then sitting down settling down and awaiting council.
