# Paradise Lost
A modern plain english translation of John Milton's Paradise Lost. I am simply interested in the literature. Religious notions neither here nor there. This will be subjective, as it is my own interperetation, and just done in my free time. Progress in this is equal to my progress reading the actual book. If you'd like to open an issue for a suggestion or correction, please do! But do this only for the interperetations so far, please do not go further into the book than what is presented here. Thank you.

## Book I

Satan revolted from God and was cast out to Chaos, a dark abyss. With him he took legions of angels.

A considerable amount of time is spent describing the abyss.

Satan awakens his followers to council their position. He starts by seething about what God has done.

Beelzbub says to Satan: "God really kicked us out. Now what?"

Satan is in rage, believing that he still serves God's purpose.

He exits Hell (Chaos?) through a volcano? He looks to Earth and thinks, "Fine then. *This* will be what I rule." (Perhaps he did not physically go to Earth but instead is thinking of it) He aims to tell his followers of a new world.

Beelzbub says to Satan: "Won't God see this? And revive his armies?"

Satan does not reply, instead storms towards his legion of fallen angels, grabs a spear and shield and launches into a speech. Basically saying "are you with me or have you fallen enough to stay fallen here?"
